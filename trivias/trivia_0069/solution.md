Python 3.3 introduced a new library called *shlex* to write lexical analyzers. You can use the *shlex.split()* method
to split a given string that uses shell-like syntax.

It provides you with an easy way to split a shell-like command to be used elsewhere. *shlex* also have the inverse
operation with the *shelx.join()* method.
