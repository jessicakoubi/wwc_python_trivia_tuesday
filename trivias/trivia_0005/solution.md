The get_close_matches() function in the difflib module can be used to return a list of the best "good enough" matches. We set the optional "n" parameter to 1 in order to only return the word with the highest similarity score to the word "be". The order of the resulting matches is determined by the heapq.nlargest() function using the measure of each word similarity where T is the total number of elements in both words, and M is the number of matches (2.0*M / T).
