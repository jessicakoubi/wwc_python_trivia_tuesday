# Solution

**C**

The **str.strip()** method return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed. By default it will remove whitespace, however you can pass in a string with the
set of characters you want to remove to the *chars* argument. The *chars* argument is neither a prefix or suffix, all combinations of its values will be stripped.
