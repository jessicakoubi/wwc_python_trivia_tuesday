# Solution

**A**

A *while* loop allow code to be executed repeatedly until a condition is met. In our case, we start with the number
23 assigned to the variable **a** and execute a loop that remove 1 from **a** each time until **a** is equal to 8.

When using while loops, make sure that the condition can be reached otherwise your code will execute forever.
